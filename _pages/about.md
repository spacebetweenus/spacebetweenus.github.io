Welcome! I'm Guanchen Wu, a first-year graduate student on the computer science track at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. Degree in computer science at the University of California, Irvine. My research interest lies in machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining.

You can find my CV here: [Guanchen Wu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv.pdf)
